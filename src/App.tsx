  { name: "The Conspiracy Carousel", desc: "Falsely labeling a survivor with mental-health issues — their favorite is schizophrenia — and playing every side, including your own family, to push you toward involuntary commitment." },
  { name: "The \"That's a nice ____\"", desc: "Strangers keep complimenting what you own or wear, to sensitize you to it. The goal is that you second-guess your reality and fixate all day on who is 'in on it'." },
  { name: "Honey Pot", desc: "A fake friend, roommate, or romantic partner pushed hard into your life — to entrap you, extract information, or attach themselves to the people around you." },
  { name: "Entrapment / Bait", desc: "Baiting you into drugs, a gun purchase, spending, or anything illegal or discrediting. The default answer to whatever they ask: don't do it." },
  { name: "Staged \"Needing Help\"", desc: "Theater of someone needing rescue — a fall, a crisis, a fight — staged near you to provoke a reaction they can film, frame, or use." },
  { name: "Good Cop, Bad Cop", desc: "One harasses you while another plays your friend. Both are the same setup — the friendly one is collecting what the hostile one couldn't." },
  { name: "Fake Counselor / Fake Help", desc: "A 'counselor', advocate, or helper who is really a paid vigilante — building a case to set you up for an institution or slander instead of helping." },
  { name: "Lure to a Location", desc: "Pushing you to go somewhere specific — a shelter, an office, a meetup — where a setup is already waiting for you." },
  { name: "Staged Narratives / Loud \"Podcasts\"", desc: "Loud pre-recorded 'podcasts' or scripted conversations played near you, carrying handler-approved messages meant to provoke you or steer your decisions." },
  { name: "The Fabricated Flaw", desc: "They invent a flaw and hammer it with staged criticism timed to be absurd — told \"you stink\" on your way to the shower after hours in 100-degree heat. The goal is to make you overly self-critical, and to record the remark so operatives who know nothing believe the \"problem\" is real and recurring." },
  { name: "The Pot and Kettle", desc: "The insult comes from someone who visibly is the thing they are accusing you of — a fat person calling you fat, a disabled person mocking your disability. The mismatch is deliberate and obnoxious: it forces the operative to live a lie while still aiming at your self-esteem." },
  { name: "Staged Road Rage", desc: "A cyclist or pedestrian steps in front of your car at the last second — usually a pump fake, sometimes a real strike — to provoke a reaction someone is already filming. Footage of a survivor \"raging\" is what they show people to recruit them." },
  { name: "The Insurance Bleed", desc: "Your car gets hit again and again. Every claim raises your premium until you are bleeding money or cannot stay insured at all. The damage is the point, not the accident." },
  { name: "Road Sensitization", desc: "High beams flashed in your mirror, brake checks, cars pacing you or boxing you in — repeated until every drive is something you have to read and second-guess." },
  { name: "The Poisoned Well", desc: "Someone new is steered into your orbit, and gossip about them is staged where they can hear it — set up to read as if it came from you. Then another operative asks you something loaded about that same person, hoping you will say something they can carry back. You are disliked before you ever really meet, and that dislike is what they recruit from." },
  { name: "The Windfall", desc: "Someone around you suddenly gets lucky — a scholarship, a job, a whirlwind marriage or baby. It lifts them above you so they read you as the incompetent one when it is often the reverse, surrounds them with new \"friends\" who are there to use them, and leaves you second-guessing yourself. A flattered person is easy to recruit." },
  { name: "The Jinx", desc: "Someone around you gets hit — a costly ticket, a crash, stolen items, a repair bill — and is then told that you are the reason it happened. They cut you off, which was the point. They cause the problem, then sell the story that explains it." },
  { name: "The Fake Job", desc: "An offer good enough to leave your current job for, and then you are let go shortly after. The old job is gone, the next one is harder to reach, and you are worse off than before you moved." },
  { name: "The Warm Spell", desc: "Weeks or months of them acting friendly, then the harassment resumes — the name-calling, the violence, all of it. The kind stretch is not a break, it is part of it. It lowers your guard so someone can collect new information, it keeps you swinging between relief and dread, and it hands everyone else a reason to doubt you: they were nice to you last month." },
  { name: "Color Sensitization", desc: "The people around you all start wearing the same color, and it changes on a schedule. The cover story is that it is a trend. What gives it away is that survivors in different cities notice the same color in the same week — a real trend does not work that way, and no one person can see it happening. This is one worth logging: it only becomes visible when enough of us record it." },
  { name: "Psyop Marketing", desc: "A company you're only a customer of starts running marketing that reads like a personal message to you — built so you can't miss it and everyone else can dismiss it as coincidence. The business relationship itself becomes the harassment channel." },
  { name: "The Acquire and Fold", desc: "A business you rely on — a meal-kit service, a product you reorder — gets bought and then shut down. Nothing is said to you; your option simply disappears. Buying and closing a company is what the money is for: controlling the resources around you, and removing choices from you and from their own people alike." },
  { name: "The Engineered Delay", desc: "A driver or employee stalls on purpose — a long 'break' at a rest stop — so you miss your connection and wait hours for the next one. Nothing dramatic happens. The play is pure stolen time, and it stacks with the ticket tampering below to stretch a two-day trip toward a week." },
  { name: "The Altered Ticket", desc: "Someone with inside access rewrites your booking: extra legs added, your ticket canceled mid-route, and the email on the ticket changed so the updated itinerary never reaches you. The company's record says you called in the change yourself — so now you're arguing against your own file." },
  { name: "The Pretext Search", desc: "An ordinary precaution gets declared evidence of a crime. Locks on your luggage — TSA-approved locks — become 'a sign of drug trafficking,' and a public search or dog sniff is demanded in front of everyone. Nothing is found, and the loud story continues anyway. The absurdity is the point: it's built to trigger you and the bystanders at once." },
  { name: "The Planted Witness", desc: "Someone approaches with scripted talk and won't back off while you retreat — then tells staff you assaulted them, and a second person confirms it as a 'witness.' You're denied service over something that never happened, and the police get called on a false report. Ask for the security footage; they'll say they can't release it." },
  { name: "The Replay", desc: "Strangers reenact words from a private incident in your past — a dispute that was already resolved, even one where the other person admitted lying. It proves they know your history, and it recasts a settled matter as if you had been the problem all along." },
  { name: "The Sensitization Skit", desc: "First they prime you: an ordinary item, mannerism, or question is repeated around you until it reads as a signal. Then comes the skit — someone forces a public confrontation about that exact thing, won't disengage while you back away, and escalates until you react. A second person then tells everyone you're overreacting, or worse, that you got violent. Your reaction to the setup — not the setup — becomes the story, and bystanders who aren't in on it repeat it in good faith as proof you're unstable." },
  { name: "The Staged Run-In", desc: "Your trip gets delayed, rebooked, or rerouted — and somehow the same strangers keep crossing your path, with a meet-cute here and a small altercation there. The crossings are engineered: your logistics are bent so you run into them, and later those same people can claim they know you. A manufactured stranger becomes a credible 'witness' or 'acquaintance' — and your world fills with familiar faces you never actually met." },
  { name: "The Staged Exposure", desc: "When the honey pot is refused, they go for exposure instead. The setup leans on rules that sound reasonable on their own — shelters and transitional housing where showers and doors can't lock, staff who hold the keys — plus timing: you're keyed in, and the moment you've undressed the door opens, exposing you to a stranger. The laughter is the tell that the 'accident' was the point. Many report the worst end of this: assault and rape. The honey pot is the lure version; this one needs nothing from you but presence." },
  { name: "The Good Day, Bad Day", desc: "Your days get scheduled, then graded. A fixed weekday made reliably bad, weekends a favorite target — so the dread shows up before anything happens. Then comes the polling: was it a good day, a bad day, a bad weekend? And the echo, in phrases nobody else can catch: 'have a good day,' 'hope you had a good weekend' — delivered pointedly after a day they made bad. Any scheme can fill a bad day; this one names the layer above them all, where your harm is the raw material and the grading is the entertainment. Multiple survivors report the same weekday structure independently — which is exactly what shared trend data can prove." },
  { name: "The Forced Homecoming", desc: "They make you destitute until the only roof left belongs to family who abuse you — and now you depend on them for money. Then they saturate the address: the neighborhood bought up, full-timers circling all day, and the family itself paid in perks, jobs, friends and sex to run the harassment from inside the house. It hands them two things. Grading your days gets easy when one of them lives with you. And it is the cheapest way to get you labeled mentally ill or dangerous, because you are isolated with your abusers and there is no witness who isn't on their payroll. Farah has had this tried on her repeatedly for over a decade and strongly discourages the arrangement: it is where the worst outcomes happen, because the harassment never stops and there is nowhere in the house to go." },
  { name: "Not listed", desc: "A scheme that doesn't fit the named list yet. Weavers of the Commons can pick it in ClickLog and describe what happened — that description goes to the owner, and it's how new schemes earn a name." },
